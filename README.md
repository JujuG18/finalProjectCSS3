# Introduction to CSS3 in the University of Michigan

The objectives of my final project were: 

- Create a style sheet and link it to the html files, without changing the html;
- Style the sheet using the properties I learnt in this online course.  There was a particular emphasis on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. For instance, Ã­ had to style the first element of each row to be left-aligned.  The rest should be centered.  


Here were the steps to style the following:

- The table should be styled using at least four  properties;
- The table headings should have a thicker bottom border with the top two corners rounded, a background color, and at least one other property;
- Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered;
- Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8;
- Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over;
- The table elements <td> should be styled using at least four  properties.
